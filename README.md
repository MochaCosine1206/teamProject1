 Tasty Maps is your tool for survival.
 
  - Have you ever found yourself in a place, hungry, with nowhere to eat?
     - **Tasty Maps** has your back.
     
     With Tasty Maps you can find all the best restaurants through the Zamato API that are near your location.
     
  - We used the following APIs in this project:
     - Nominatim - for geocoding services
     - Leaflet - for map generation
     - Mapbox - for map tiles
     - Zamato - for restaurant data
     - Wikipedia - for supplemental location info
     - OpenWeatherMaps - just for kicks.
     
     Never go hungry or get wet on a patio ever again with tasty maps!
